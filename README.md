# Portfolio-Attempt1
##Purpose
The purpose of this Portfolio page is to have a virtual, visual resume of sorts. Instead of providing future employers with a text document explaining what I can do and ways they can get in contact with me, the portfolio in includes links to multiple, actual, completed projects along with links to my social media pages. These linked social media pages highlight my other skills and hobbies, which may be of interest to someone looking for a well rounded candidate.
